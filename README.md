# Markdown Table of Content
this is a python script which can generate table of content(toc) for markdown file.

## How to use?

### First time to use
In cl,use _cd_ to open the project folder and run:

    `python toc.py <path to your markdown file>`

backup of your markdownfile is in markdown folder.The program will rewrite your markdown file,so for savety,we auto-backup the file.

### Generate again.
when you change the content,just run the command again.The program will clean the previous toc first,and generate a new toc for you.

### Future work
Now the program can preocess mixed language file,but sometimes it doesn't work.I am work on it.

## More Example
to see more examples,you can dir to test folder to see a more difficult example which has English and Chinese header.By the way,the toc of this file is also generate by this program.
